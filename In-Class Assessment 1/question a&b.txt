(a) Cloud Service Models in Cloud Computing
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers fundamental infrastructure components like virtual machines, storage, and networking.

Example in software development: A development team uses AWS EC2 to create multiple virtual machines for different environments (development, testing, staging). They can quickly scale resources up/down based on project needs and only pay for what they use.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides a platform allowing developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.

Example in software development: A team uses Heroku or Google App Engine to deploy a web application. They focus solely on writing code while the platform handles scaling, load balancing, and database management automatically.

Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance.

Example in software development: Development teams use GitHub for version control, Slack for communication, and Jira for project management. These tools are accessed via web browsers without any infrastructure management.

(b) Docker and Containerization
What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that uses containerization technology to package applications and their dependencies into standardized units called containers. These containers are lightweight, portable, and ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

Scenario for Using Docker:
Microservices Architecture Development

In a microservices-based e-commerce application, I would use Docker to containerize each service (user service, product catalog, payment processing, order management). Each microservice runs in its own container with specific dependencies.

How Containerization Contributes:
Isolation: Each service runs independently, preventing dependency conflicts

Consistency: Containers ensure the application behaves identically from development to production

Rapid Deployment: New features can be deployed to individual services without affecting others

Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand

CI/CD Integration: Containers streamline automated testing and deployment pipelines
