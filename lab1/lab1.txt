Lab 1: Virtualization and Cloud Basics
1. Check if your processor supports Intel/AMD virtualization technology. Enable Intel virtualization technology in BIOS if possible.
I checked my processor using Task Manager (Performance → CPU).
It shows that virtualization is supported. I also enabled Intel Virtualization Technology in the BIOS settings.

2. What are the fundamental reasons behind the success of cloud computing? Name three pros and three cons.
Reasons for success:
Easy access to resources through the internet
No need to buy expensive hardware

Flexible and scalable services
Pros:
Cost saving
High scalability
Easy access from anywhere
Cons:
Security and privacy concerns
Internet dependency
Limited control over infrastructure

3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?
The main function of a hypervisor is to create and manage virtual machines and allow multiple operating systems to run on one physical machine.

4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?
A virtual machine is a software-based computer that runs an operating system and applications like a real computer.

5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?
Better resource utilization
Isolation between systems
Easy backup and recovery
Run multiple OS on one machine

6. List five use cases of virtual machines.
Software testing
Running multiple operating systems
Server virtualization
Cloud computing
Learning and training environments

7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine

8. What does virtual machine isolation mean?
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.

9. What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?
c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.

10. What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
The purpose of cloning a virtual machine is to create an exact copy of an existing VM for backup, testing, or deployment purposes.
